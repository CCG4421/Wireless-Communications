#  5G NR Sparse Channel Estimation and Mobility Robustness
-  Authorï¼šChenchen Guo    cg4421
- This project implements a complete physical-layer simulation of the 5G NR downlink with MMSE and Sparse-MMSE channel estimation under realistic multipath fading. The simulation incorporates EPA fading profiles and UE mobility (via Doppler shifts), and evaluates estimator performance across SNR and speed settings.

> This work extends Lab7 by introducing EPA channels, Sparse post-processing, and adaptive thresholding.

## Features

- Modular MATLAB simulation of 5G NR downlink PHY chain
- EPA multipath fading channel with Doppler effect
- MMSE and Sparse-MMSE estimators with:
  - Fixed threshold: Ï„ = Î± Â· maxâ€–hâ€–
  - Adaptive threshold: Ï„ = Î± Â· âˆš(noise variance)
- Performance evaluation via MSE and BER
- Visual comparisons at multiple speeds (30, 60, 120 m/s)
- All plots reproducible from `.mlx` file
